0. look at the B-values produced, to confirm:
        - none are wildly large, eg > 2.0 - confirmed
        - expect to see most values quite small, eg fabs(v) < 0.001 - confirmed
        - expect to see at least a few values not small, eg 0.1 < fabs(v) < 1 - confirmed
1. confirm the inverse matrix is good, using multiply to produce the identity matrix
2. re-task all the data to begin on 1994-Jul-01 or whenever the indices start
        - confirm the B-values are still not good, by criteria above
3. check the models, by comparing:
        - the RMS of the asxStock - expect about 1% or so
        - the RMS of the (asxStock - predicted) - expect (hope) for alot less than RMS of the stock
4. calculate the stock-model correlations
5. set up the updater, and update the data from yahoo finance
6. run a simulation:
        use data from 1994-07-01..1999-12-31 as historical
        simulate from 2000-01-01..present - determine worst / avg / best return
7. set up to generate value for each day in the morning, and then watch the value (www.asx.com.au)

optional: maybe cut down on the number of predictors, to increase speed
        eliminate ones that have consistently small B-values

8. get account with www.cmcmarkets.com.au to trade using highly-leveraged CFDs
9. probably get the list of most-commonly-traded stocks, so then just select between those
        because those should have lower margin costs
