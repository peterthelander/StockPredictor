Change in strategy:

Predict the asx sector indices, because they are commission-free on cmc markets.

Commissions are important: eg
Using 100k principal
Setting up 9 positions of 5k margin each, at 20:1 so 100k market value each, 900k market value total.
Commission is 0.1% on each trade direction buy and sell, so that's 900000 * 0.1/100 * 2 = 1800 in commissions alone.
Possibly expecting (ideal case) to get +5k on the day, so commissions cut out more than one third of the profit.

NOTE: If turnover per month is > 2m (and it will be) then commision per trade is 0.06%
        => 540 per day of the above example
        => not too bad


ASX Indices (historical data):

Also, should get all available major us indices as predictors (aside from non-stock ones like nasdaq volume)

Criteria: need these characteristics of asx sector index cfds:
        1. System can predict them as well as stocks
        2. Spread is low
        3. Volume is high

Also, index and sector cfds allow leverage of 1% !!!




Typical spread
        high spreads might be 1/400 = 0.25%
        low spreads might be 1/10000 = 0.01%
