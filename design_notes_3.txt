Final Result for Friday 9-May                                                      
        OSH        Predicted gain, but actual loss 0.5% - bad (at the end of the day, actual slight gain - still, not much, so should have seen it was not good)
        NWS        Predicted loss, and actual loss 1.1% - good                                        
                        => refinement                                
                                NWS loss was good because previous day was big up, so plenty of room to move down                        
                                OSH should have gained but really lost slightly                        
                                        because previous day was already big gain, so had to move down to recover
                        => need to take in to account previous day move                
                Make model mapping from input to output, WHERE                        
                        input is 1 * us(last night - 1) + 2 * us(last night)                
                        output is 1 * asx(yesterday) + 2 * asx(today)                
                        so predicting the weighted average of yesterday and today                
                                AND yesterday is known already        
                        SO for example if prediction of +1%                
                                AND yesterday asx move is +2%        
                                THEN today prediction is 0
